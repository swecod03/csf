<h3>
Problem 3 (Statements)
</h3>
<!-- Practice properly implementing statements -->
Proper statement structer ensures that the program will function as intended.

Write a short piece of code that uses if, elif, and else.

Here's some information to feed into you code.

I like apple pie.
I hate peach pie.
I don't mind other types of pie.


<h3>
Problem 4 (Sets, lists, and dictionaries! Oh MY!)
</h3>
Create a set with "Star Ratings" of 1-5 that I might give to pies I don't hate.

Create a list of six different types pies [ apple, peach, blueberry, rhubarb, pumpkin, chocolate ]

Other than Apple(which is my favorite, and is most definitely a 5) and Peach(which I hate and is clearly a zero)
you may rate the other pies however you like.

Create a Dictionary that has key:value == pie:rating


<h3>
Problem 5 (Ring Ring, this is Function calling)
</h3>
<!-- Create a function that searches a dictionary>

<!-- Add the text of your problem 5 here -->

<h3>
Problem 6 (Ill Iteration)
</h3>


using the dictionary in number 4 create a rating system for each pie and its classification output your results 
create a loop to run for the top 3 pies per pie type. 
if value is greater then 3 print value


<h3>
Problem 7 (Piece of cake to bake a pretty cake)
</h3>
using range generate your own list for top pies that is 10 pies long.
using the top rated pies in problem 6, compare both lists, then compare each pies rating output the top 4 pies.
